## Introduction
In this project, I aimed to combine all other projects learned tools into one and create a cozy camping scene on a floating island in space using low-poly .obj files. The island features various objects and a campfire, with a rotating starry sky to create a serene and immersive environment. Additionally, I incorporated a low-poly fire effect with dynamic lighting and particle effects to enhance the realism of the scene.

## Tools/Technologies Used
1. **Fire Effects**:
   - **Lighting**: Used lighting to create a random flashing visual effect for the fire.
   - **Particles**: Implemented particle effects to simulate a living fire with varying sizes and intervals.

2. **Sky Scene**:
   - **Texture Mapping**: Mapped a star/galaxy texture onto a sphere to simulate the night sky.
   - **Animation**: Added slight rotation to the sky sphere to create the illusion of moving stars.

## Motivations
I am a huge fan of low-poly graphics and video games, finding them visually appealing. This project allowed me to create a peaceful floating island scene, combining my love for low-poly aesthetics with a relaxing, creative endeavor. Additionally, this project offered a break from the complexity of my current math classes.

## What I Did
- Created a floating island with a starry sky background that rotates.
- Implemented a low-poly fire with particle effects and a flickering light using keyframing.
- Used a high-resolution star texture to enhance the background.
- Added multiple viewpoints controlled by key binds to explore the scene from different angles.

## Cleverness
Creating particle effects for the fire involved significant learning and experimentation. Using ChatGPT 3.5, I iteratively refined prompts to generate a plausible fire effect, documenting each step and modification. This process provided valuable insights into particle systems and shader usage.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Particle Systems**: Learned the structure and setup of particle systems, which involve random generation and mathematical equations to animate particles.
- **OBJ Files**: Gained a better understanding of working with .obj files, including coloring and splitting parts into mini obj files for different colors, textures, shaders, etc.
- **Lighting**: Improved my knowledge of tuning lighting effects, though I still seek to fine-tune flickering effects.
- **Perspective vs. Orthographic Views**: Understood the impact of perspective and orthographic views on textures and object visibility.
- **OpenGL Pros and Cons**: Recognized the strengths and limitations of OpenGL, especially regarding trial-and-error placement and sizing of objects, highlighting the need for a live view mode for efficiency.
